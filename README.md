# visu_colorimetrique
Visualize the chromatic sphere w/ Processing &amp; Arduinod

See https://github.com/b2renger for orginal codes. Ressources in english and french for basis and more. I used his code to make those one.

The purpose is to visualize the color in 3D ; and how it can be represented by 3D object. This is the first attempt, I will develop this concept more further soon.
